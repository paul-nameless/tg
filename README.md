```

Arch Linux users can install from the AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/telegram-tg-git/

```bash
yay -S telegram-tg-git
```

## Optional dependencies

- [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier) for Mac (used by default). You can change it to [dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) for Linux or any other notifications program (see `NOTIFY_CMD` in configuration)
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to record voice msgs and upload videos.
- [tdlib](https://tdlib.github.io/td/build.html?language=Python) - in case of incompatibility with built in package.
  For example, macOS:
  ```sh
  brew install tdlib
  ```
  and then set in config `TDLIB_PATH`
- `urlview` to choose urls when there is multiple in message, use `URL_VIEW` in config file to use another app (it should accept urls in stdin)


## Configuration

Config file should be stored at `~/.config/tg/conf.py`. This is simple python file.

### Simple config:

```python
PHONE = "[your phone number]"
```

### Advanced configuration:

```python
import os

# You can write anything you want here, file will be executed at start time
# You can keep you sensitive information in password managers or gpg
# encrypted files for example
def get_pass(key):
    # retrieves key from password store
    return os.popen("pass show {} | head -n 1".format(key)).read().strip()


PHONE = get_pass("i/telegram-phone")
# encrypt you local tdlib database with the key
ENC_KEY = get_pass("i/telegram-enc-key")

# log level for debugging, info by default
LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"
# path where logs will be stored (all.log and error.log)
LOG_PATH = "~/.local/share/tg/"

# If you have problems with tdlib shipped with the client, you can install and
# use your own, for example:
TDLIB_PATH = "/usr/local/Cellar/tdlib/1.6.0/lib/libtdjson.dylib"

# you can use any other notification cmd, it is simple python string which
# can format title, msg, subtitle and icon_path paramters
# In these exapmle, kitty terminal is used and when notification is pressed
# it will focus on the tab of running tg
NOTIFY_CMD = "/usr/local/bin/terminal-notifier -title {title} -subtitle {subtitle} -message {msg} -appIcon {icon_path} -sound default -execute '/Applications/kitty.app/Contents/MacOS/kitty @ --to unix:/tmp/kitty focus-tab --no-response -m title:tg'"

# You can use your own voice recording cmd but it's better to use default one.
# The voice note must be encoded with the Opus codec, and stored inside an OGG
# container. Voice notes can have only a single audio channel.
VOICE_RECORD_CMD = "ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i ':0' -c:a libopus -b:a 32k {file_path}"

# You can customize chat and msg flags however you want.
# By default words will be used for readability, but you can make
# it as simple as one letter flags like in mutt or add emojies
CHAT_FLAGS = {
    "online": "‚óè",
    "pinned": "P",
    "muted": "M",
    # chat is marked as unread
    "unread": "U",
    # last msg haven't been seen by recipient
    "unseen": "‚úì",
}
MSG_FLAGS = {
    "selected": "*",
    "forwarded": "F",
    "new": "N",
    "unseen": "U",
    "edited": "E",
    "pending": "...",
    "failed": "üí©",
}

# use this app to open url when there are multiple
URL_VIEW = 'urlview'

# Specifies range of colors to use for drawing users with
# different colors
# this one uses base 16 colors which should look good by default
USERS_COLORS = tuple(range(2, 16))

# to use 256 colors, set range appropriately
# though 233 looks better, because last colors are black and gray
# USERS_COLORS = tuple(range(233))

# to make one color for all users
# USERS_COLORS = (4,)

# cleanup cache
# Values: N days, None (never)
KEEP_MEDIA = 7
```

### Mailcap file

Mailcap file is used for deciding how to open telegram files (docs, pics, voice notes, etc.).

Example: `~/.mailcap`

```ini
# media
video/*; mpv "%s"
audio/ogg; mpv --speed 1.33 "%s"
audio/mpeg; mpv --no-video "%s"
image/*; qView "%s"

# text
text/html; w3m "%s"
text/html; open -a Firefox "%s"
text/plain; less "%s"

# fallback to vim
text/*; vim "%s"
```
